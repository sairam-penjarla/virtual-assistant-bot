Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
























L&T is a large conglomerate 
and 
has beautifully woven 
a 
rich and colourful fabric which includes not just India but multiple countries as well. Multiculturality is an integral part of our ethos, which is evident from the fact that our employees belong to 52 nationalities, 36 domiciles (across states and UTs) within India and speak 80 unique languages. We are proud of and celebrate the diversity which adds to the richness of L&T.


We consciously work towards building gender diversity and inclusion through a structured and systematic framework. A DEI Charter has been drafted which rests on four pillars of Induct, Develop, Engage, and Enable.




Concrete actions have been taken under each pillar of Induct, Develop, Engage, and Enable of the DEI Charter to ensure the environment is inclusive.








Induct




Campus Recruitment
: Our largest hiring happens at the Trainees level. We hire across disciplines including the core disciplines. Through sustained efforts by the Campus Recruitment over the course of the last few years, the current batch of GETs and PGETs 2022 had a combined intake of 30% women.


Renew – Career Reentry Program:  
To encourage women re-entering workforce, a program Renew has been instituted. Through this program, we attract professionally qualified women who had taken a career break and want to resume active workforce.

Engage




It is important to take the DEI Campaign to the larger employee base within the organization. To inspire people to own and adopt DEI holistically within L&T, with a focus on Gender Diversity, a far-reaching program, Winspire has been launched. This program comprises the following elements -




Interviews with Women Leaders within L&T and outside


Panel Discussions


Quiz – Know Your Women Leaders


Various Contests to encourage large scale participation




Further, we also have online modules which sensitize employees not just towards gender, but also diversity across generation, region, age, personality, and unconscious bias.








Develop




To help women own and hone their leadership identity, we have in place  Development interventions like Winspire Rise and Winspire Propel for Early and Mid level Leadership positions. 


WINSPIRE RISE
: We have designed an Early Leadership Program for Women covering elements of Self discovery and goal setting; Impactful workplace interaction and presence; Personal Branding and Story Telling for Influencing; and Work-Life integration and Managing Inner Critic.


WINSPIRE PROPEL
: It is a Leadership Journey program for women in their mid career. The purpose of this program is to explore elements that Women experience and must navigate in pursuing their leadership journey. It is centered on four pillars – Lead Self, Lead Others, Navigating through the Organisation and Claim Your Spot. At first glance the elements may seem gender agnostic, however this program specifically looks at issues from the lens of mid-career women making their way in the organization.


The programs have had a profound impact on women and their belief in developing their leadership identity.  It is helping generate a pool of Women Leaders within L&T, ready to take up challenging roles.








Enable




Innovative policies and practices have been introduced to support the women employees at crucial junctures of their life.


The performance rating of women who go on maternity leave is protected, thereby ensuring meritorious and fair career progression. This has resulted in better engagement of women who return from Maternity Leave.


To support women on certain days when they need rest and also support Lactating mothers, Wellness Rooms for women are available at all major office locations.  Having onsite Creche is extremely helpful in getting women back to work and making them feel supported in the crucial period of life.


With these concrete steps, we will improve representation and engagement of women within L&T. We are committed to moving onwards and upwards!
