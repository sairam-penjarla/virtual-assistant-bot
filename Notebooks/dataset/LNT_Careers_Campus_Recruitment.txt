Campus Recruitment


























L&T’s Campus Recruitment teams visit India’s leading colleges, offering opportunities to bright graduates and post-graduates from various specialisations across engineering and management. The selection process is rigorous, and we look for candidates who match L&T’s value system, have a strong knowledge base, and the skill to apply concepts. Above all, we look for commitment, energy, and a passion for excellence.
 




Orientation Programme 


As part of the on-boarding process, all fresh entrants go through an Orientation Programme, which gives them an overview of the breadth of work and enables the transition from Campus to Corporate. This programme helps all Graduate and Post Graduate Trainees get acclimatized to our work culture and start delivering from day one. The programme consists of an orientation on L&T, its businesses and projects undertaken. 


The trainees work on technical projects, individual assignments, product simulations, and undergo various technical as well non-technical exercises on-line. The programme is a good mix of technical & behavioural sessions.


Trainee Categories

Post-graduate Engineer Trainees (PGETs)




Post-graduate Engineer Trainees (PGETs) play a crucial role in various businesses of L&T, covering functions such as Research & Development, Design, Engineering and New Product / Process Development. PGETs get a role very specific to their area of specialisation at the post graduate level. 


Activities that are typically envisaged for PGETs are: design calculations, computer-aided high-end engineering analysis, simulation, optimisation, basic and detail engineering, new product or process design / manufacturing, troubleshooting, failure analysis and new technology development. 


These require some degree of specialisation in a relevant engineering discipline, over and above the basic capabilities and knowledge base of a Graduate Engineer. The academic background of a PGET, academic project work carried out and his / her performance during the selection process determines the suitability of the candidate for an intended function. However, a balanced skill development plan through appropriate internal / external training intervention is necessary to enable the PGETs to develop and perform to their fullest potential. 


The programme trains the students in deeper theoretical knowledge which will enable them to tackle practical complex problems of design and development in industrial fields, as well as pursue further academic achievements through research.
