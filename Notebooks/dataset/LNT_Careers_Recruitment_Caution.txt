Recruitment Caution - Clarification in Public Interest
























It has been brought to our attention that certain unscrupulous elements are sending out false emails purporting to be from Larsen & Toubro Limited (“L&T”). The emails ask the recipient to appear for a face-to-face interview for a job opening with L&T and to deposit a certain amount as a refundable interview security in a designated bank account. The emails are falsely stated to be from officials of the HR Department of L&T.


L&T has not sent out any such emails. Please note that L&T, as a policy, does not collect any money as a pre-employment requirement. L&T and its affiliate companies bear no responsibility for amounts being deposited / withdrawn therefrom in response to such emails. 


These communications may carry the ID or domain name of L&T (or a deceptively similar name) to make it look authentic. L&T is taking appropriate steps to tackle the issue.


As a vigilant jobseeker, please look out for the following pointers to identify the fraudulent emails:




L&T does not ask for any money from the candidate at any stage of the recruitment process


A fraudulent email may mention the bank account number of an individual 
or
  the account details would be given upon calling up on the number mentioned in the fraudulent mail. In any case the bank account would not be in the name of “Larsen & Toubro Ltd.”


L&T letters will address job applicants with proper salutations including the last name (not with generic greetings)


Please check if you receive calls from the L&T registered numbers or from a private number




We advise candidates not to respond to any fraudulent emails and not to make any payments. In case of any doubt please contact L&T’s Toll Free No. 
18002094545.
