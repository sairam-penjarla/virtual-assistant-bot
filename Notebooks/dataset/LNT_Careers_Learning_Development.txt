Growing with L&T


At L&T, Learning & Development is an integral part of the organisation’s DNA, significantly contributing to organisational, group and individual effectiveness & growth by fostering a strong and structured learning culture.


Basis market drivers, organisation goals and long-term strategic plans, we focus our energies on the following thrust areas:




Deliver results and impact organisational performance


Constantly scan the rapidly changing environment and equip employees at all times with the required knowledge, skills, and competencies


Leadership development


Develop corporate citizens

Focus on action-oriented training


Synergise and optimise efforts - avoiding overlap and duplication and build a uniform curriculum




A culture of continuous learning and development exists through structured core developmental programmes, conducted by reputed institutions for employees to develop superior management skills and capabilities. A host of technical and behavioural programmes are also conducted to address specific training and developmental needs of employees.








Leadership Development Academy




Started in 1997 at Lonavla, our Leadership Development Academy offers world-class facilities to deliver learning & development programmes to employees throughout the year. It is unmatched in the country for the scale of its vision and the detail of its execution. A one-of-a-kind destination, it houses all infrastructure required to conduct various kinds of training and development programmes.   


LDA recognises that learning happens during the dialectic of a classroom, in the private intensity of a library, or in the quite repose of a recreation room. This integrated facility provides it all. This "temple of learning" offers a platform to interact across geographies in the development of future leaders and global corporate entrepreneurs.

Institute of Project Management 




L&T has been at the forefront of large and complex projects across the engineering spectrum. Putting our knowledge and diverse experience to work and recognising the need for bringing in experiential learning into the realm of projects, we established a one-of-a-kind institute in the industry – L&T Institute of Project Management (L&T I'PM). 


The Institute has two campuses - Vadodara and Chennai. Its Vision is “To develop a premier world class education centre, for creating global project management professionals, thereby making L&T a centre of excellence in project management.”

Key Initiatives




Seven Step Leadership Pipeline
 


Seven Step Leadership Pipeline comprises a series of programmes and interventions strategically designed with the objective of creating a pool of leaders at various levels of the organisation. Employees from as young as an experience band of 10-12 years to the highest level undergo development mechanisms which equip them with the competencies to build themselves as the leaders of L&T’s tomorrow. These mechanisms contain elements including, but not limited to, management education, building a foundation for robust leadership, risk and strategy, financial acumen, and a global outlook. Further, L&T’s leadership too plays a crucial role of personally mentoring the future leaders.  


For many of these programmes, L&T partners with nationally and globally renowned senior faculty and institutions.  


ATLNext
 


L&T has established a scalable, multi-featured and integrated Digital Learning Platform called ATLNext
. 
Keeping its tradition of being pioneers, L&T’s digital learning journey dates back to  2006, when a Learning Management System (LMS) was launched under the  name “ATL’. This  was upgraded to Learning Experience Platform (LXP) in  2016, which is powered by Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and Natural Language Processing technologies. 


It offers a range of online courses including competency courses, behavioural courses, and business-specific technical courses to meet the demands of learners. Besides online courses, it provides access to on-line data bases, references, management videos, e-books and thousands of journals. 


A powerful AI driven recommendation engine makes learning fun and intuitive which automates the learning process and improves learning effectiveness, thereby, providing a very personalised experience to learners.   


Centre of Excellence
 


To nurture and promote a culture of Operation Excellence, Business Excellence & HR Excellence, a ‘Centre of Excellence’ for Improvement Initiatives (CoE) was set up. It focuses on specialised programmes on quality, safety and operational excellence such as Value Engineering, Six Sigma, TQM, Gemba Kaizen, NEBOSH, IOSH etc. It also promotes awareness about various Business Excellence Models and HR Excellence models such as EFQM Model, CII Model etc and takes a structured approach to develop a large pool of accredited assessors and practitioners of Excellence models.
