SUSTAINABILITY
L&T is one of the ﬁrst few organisations in India to voluntarily 
set sustainability targets aligned with the Company’s Business 
Plan, Lakshya. During the year, the Company’s 5-year Strategic 
Plan was developed through a collaborative and consultative 
process across the organisation. As part of the Lakshya 2026 
plan, the Group has re-evaluated shareholder value creation, 
deﬁned social obligations, and framed sustainability goals.
This year, we have integrated our statutory and non-statutory 
disclosures (Annual Report and Integrated Report) and 
published our ﬁrst Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report (BRSR). The Integrated Report is based on the 
International Integrated Reporting Framework (IIRC) and 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. The report 
demonstrates the interlinkage between the various capitals, i.e. Financial, Natural, Intellectual, Manufactured, Social and 
Relationship and Human capitals. It provides an insight into the 
organisation’s strategy, governance, social, environmental and 
economic context within which company operates.
At L&T, we have been taking concerted efforts towards 
achieving resource ef ﬁciency and decarbonising our businesses. 
We are revisiting our vision, policies, frameworks, roadmaps 
and action plans to deliver solutions towards building a better 
future. L&T is investing and growing equitably to improve its 
sustainability performance. By embracing a digital future, robust 
risk management process, strong stakeholder dialogues, and
