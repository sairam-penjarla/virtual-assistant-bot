Tech-led innovation for sustainable growth is deeply rooted in our business. We believe that our vision for a better world can be achieved through ‘Engineering a Sustainable Future” for all. Through optimal use of energy, decarbonizing energy consumption through renewable energy, reducing water consumption, waste minimisation and management, use of recycled material and adopting sustainable processes, we aim to keep amplifying our positive impact on the planet and its people, thus creating a meaningful impact for our stakeholders. We have committed towards achieving carbon and water neutrality, and a snapshot of progress made is showcased here.








Energy


In FY 2023-24, L&T’s total energy consumption was 10.5 Mn GJ, comprising direct energy consumption of 8.8 Mn GJ and indirect energy consumption of 1.7 Mn GJ. Total energy intensity has decreased by 15.9% compared to FY 2022-23 and 13% compared to FY 2020-21 (baseline).




Total energy intensity decreased by 15.9% in FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2022-23, primarily due to a reduction in direct energy intensity by 19.3%. Diesel contributes to more than 95% of direct energy consumption. Many project sites have switched to grid electricity from DG and new project sites are being executed with grid connections from the initial stage itself. Additionally, closure or tapering down of certain projects and reduction in on site civil construction activities in a few projects, contributed to lower diesel consumption compared to FY 2022-23.

GHG Emissions


Emissions attributed to L&T’s operations arise primarily from the use of fossil fuels, electricity, and material in its operations and processes. Emissions (Scope 1+2) intensity has decreased by 12.2% in FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2022-23 mainly due to a reduction in direct energy consumption intensity.




Scope 1 Emissions arise from consumption of fuels such as petrol, high-speed diesel, furnace oil, natural gas, LPG, CNG, and acetylene in various construction machinery, diesel generators, and furnaces. Scope 2 Emissions arise from consumption of grid electricity, sourced from DISCOMs, in various machinery, manufacturing facilities, and offices. Scope 3 Emissions are currently being reported based purchased goods, upstream transportation and distribution, employee commuting, and business travel.

Water


Water consumption for L&T is primarily driven by water required in civil works in EPC projects. The Company has identified various initiatives to reduce water consumption and increase wastewater recycling at project sites and manufacturing facilities.




The Company has identified various initiatives to reduce water consumption and increase wastewater recycling at project sites and manufacturing facilities. The manufacturing facilities and even a few projects are Zero Liquid Discharge locations, mostly recycling and reusing the wastewater generated for various purpose. For example, gardening, toilet flushing, and ancillary activities in construction sites, such as dust suppression, equipment washing, and other areas.

Waste and Circular Economy


Waste management is a material topic and a key focus area for L&T due to the volume and type of material used in EPC projects and manufacturing.




The significant increase in waste generation is due to enhancement in waste data capturing/reporting across different businesses and on account of higher material consumption linked to significantly higher execution. The strategy to manage waste is aligned with the principles of Circular Economy and focusses on the 3Rs, i.e., Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Waste Management is integrated into the EHS management system with comprehensive guidelines and procedures to ensure proper waste management.

Biodiversity


L&T planted ~4 million saplings in FY 2023-24, with over 99% planted by Water & Effluent Treatment (WET) business.

Over the years (2008-2024), L&T has planted around 13 million saplings. During 15-17 August 2023, a massive plantation drive 'Project GreenHands' was undertaken with more than 2.5 million saplings planted across 559 project sites.
